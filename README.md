A program that creates AIs that play the game "chopsticks" against each other and human players. 

to get the program editable, open each file you want to edit in any java code editor, such as jgrasp.
to run the program, get it into an editor and run the "RunGame" file.
the program will load the existing AI (currently simply named filename), and play it against a random AI for 50-100 games, depending on its winrate. it will then play 3 games against the user. to play the game, answer the questions it asks about what moves you are making. if you want to change how many games the AI plays against the random one, edit the rungame file. that is also where you can change how many games it plays against the user.
this project uses saving and loading of files, as well as course concepts such as scanner and arrays.
